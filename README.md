This project is a map blog of the Everest Base Camp 3 Pass Trek I undertook in May 2016.

I've acquired the data from Google Maps API via the Google Cloud Platform and [gpsies.com](gpsies.com)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It uses React, Redux and TypeScript and is hosted on [http://coderbear.com/ebcd](http://coderbear.com/ebcd) via GitHub Pages.

Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/siddhartha_b) and thanks for checking this out!
