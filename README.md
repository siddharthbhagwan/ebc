This project is a map blog of the Everest Base Camp 3 Pass Trek I undertook in May 2016.

I've acquired data from Google Maps and [gpsies.com](gpsies.com)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The project uses React and TypeScript and is hosted on [http://coderbear.com/ebc-dashboard](http://coderbear.com/ebc-dashboard) via GitHub pages.
